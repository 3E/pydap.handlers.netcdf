pydap.handlers.netcdf
=====================

This handler allows Pydap to serve data from NetCDF files. By default 
[pupynere](http://code.dealmeida.net/pupynere) is installed as a dependency,
providing support for NetCDF 3 files. If you also want to server NetCDF 4 files
you'll need to install the [netCDF4-python](https://code.google.com/p/netcdf4-python/)
library.
